# Automatic-Signature-Stability-Analysis-And-Verification-Using-Local-Features

## To Do
 - Compare SURF, SIFT, ORB, AKAZE, BRIEF local features.
 - Understand SURF
 - Compare various distance parameters like cosine, kernel distance etc.
 - Weighted score on distance for classification
 - Two different scores for genuine vs forged and genuine vs disguised
 - Average all distances or remove matches from temporary database
 
 - Preprocessing :- normalization, histogram equalization
 - Multithreading to speed up
 - Add autoencoders and existing deep learning methods for feature extraction
 - Global descriptor
